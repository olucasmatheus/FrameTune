          FrameTune FX — v1.0
═══════════════════════════════════════════════

🛠️ Overview:
FrameTune FX is a lightweight performance configuration tool tailored for real-time applications that demand consistent responsiveness and efficient system behavior.

By offering a collection of tuned system-level adjustments, the tool helps reduce latency, limit unnecessary overhead, and improve frame stability — without modifying any core application files.

🌀 Key Capabilities:
• Performance profiles for various system types  
• Optional background process adjustments  
• Memory and CPU usage balancing  
• Focused runtime tuning with safe fallback  
• Zero modification to game/app binaries

📂 Quick Start:
1. Extract the archive anywhere outside system-protected folders.  
2. Launch `FrameTuneFX.exe` as administrator.  
3. Select a preset or adjust parameters manually.  
4. Apply and enjoy smoother operation.

♻️ Safe Reversal:
• All applied settings are temporary and fully revertible.  
• Restore points can be created before applying changes.  
• No permanent system-level hooks or changes are introduced.

⚠️ Notes:
• Some antivirus software may flag the executable due to compression and automation. This is a false positive — consider whitelisting.  
• Administrator rights are required for full functionality.  
• Not designed for online services or multiplayer environments.
